### Overall Grade: 130/130

### Quality of report: 10/10

-   Is the homework submitted (git tag time) before deadline? 

    Yes
  
-   Is the final report in a human readable format html? 

    Yes
  
-   Is the report prepared as a dynamic document (R markdown) for better reproducibility?

    Yes
  
-   Is the report clear (whole sentences, typos, grammar)? Do readers have a clear idea what's going on and how are results produced by just reading the report? 

    Yes
  
### Completeness, correctness and efficiency of solution: ??/80

- Q1 (40/40)

- Q2 (40/40) Shiny app

### Usage of Git: 10/10

-   Are branches (`master` and `develop`) correctly set up? Is the hw submission put into the `master` branch?

    Yes
  
-   Are there enough commits? Are commit messages clear? 
  
    Yes
          
-   Is the hw3 submission tagged? 

    Yes
  
-   Are the folders (`hw1`, `hw2`, ...) created correctly? 
  
    Yes
  
-   Do not put a lot auxiliary files into version control. If any unnecessary files are in Git, take 5 points off.

### Reproducibility: 10/10

This HW might be difficult to check reproducibility. 

-   Are the materials (files and instructions) submitted to the `master` branch sufficient for reproducing all the results? Just click the `knit` button will produce the final `html` on teaching server? 

    Yes
  
-   If necessary, are there clear instructions, either in report or in a separate file, how to reproduce the results?

    Yes
  
### R code style: 20/20

Each violation takes 2 points off, until all 20 points are depleted. Make sure to check coding style for shiny app (app.R) as well.
