### Quality of report: 10/10

-   Is the homework submitted (git tag time) before deadline? Take 10 pts per day for late submission.  

-   Is the final report in a human readable format html? 

-   Is the report prepared as a dynamic document (R markdown) for better reproducibility?

-   Is the report clear (whole sentences, typos, grammar)? Do readers have a clear idea what's going on and how results are produced by just reading the report? Take some points off if the solutions are too succint to grasp, or there are too many typos/grammar. 

### Completeness, correctness and efficiency of solution: 67.5/70

- Q1 (10/10)

	Is the GitHub.com repository name set up correctly? If using name other than `biostat-203b-2022-winter`, take 5 points off.

- Q2 (20/20)

	If CITI training is not completed successfully, take 15 points off. PhysioNet crecential might take longer.

- Q3 (20/20)

- Q4 (10/10)

- Q5 (10/10)
	    
### Usage of Git: 10/10

-   Are branches (`main` and `develop`) correctly set up? Is the hw submission put into the `main` branch?

-   Are there enough commits (>=5) in develop branch? Are commit messages clear? The commits should span out not clustered the day before deadline. 
          
-   Is the hw1 submission tagged? 

-   Are the folders (`hw1`, `hw2`, ...) created correctly? 
  
-   Do not put a lot auxiliary files into version control. 

-   If those gz data files or `pg42671` are in Git, take 5 points off.

### Reproducibility: 10/10

-   Are the materials (files and instructions) submitted to the `main` branch sufficient for reproducing all the results? Just click the `knit` button will produce the final `html` on teaching server? 

-   If necessary, are there clear instructions, either in report or in a separate file, how to reproduce the results?

### R code style: 20/20

For bash commands, only enforce the 80-character rule. Take 2 pts off for each violation.
